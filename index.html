<h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
<p>My name is Kellie Ortiz and I am an aspiring graphic designer. I have been very passionate about art since I was young and have been posting my art online for roughly three years now on my Instagram, to which I have garnered some followers from it. I am also proficient in HTML and CSS, and have created several website designs and web mock-ups.</p>
